# Telcom Customer Churn Prediction Model Overview

## Data Processing Pipeline
![Model Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5519ba46-9dd4-4c5c-9979-f9838d9216ec)

1. **Load Data**
   - Import the Telcom customer churn dataset
   - This dataset likely contains customer information, service usage, and churn status

2. **Preprocess Data**
   - Initial cleaning and formatting of raw data
   - Handle any inconsistencies or errors in the dataset

3. **Handle NaN**
   - Identify and manage missing values in the dataset
   - Crucial for telcom data which may have gaps in customer information or usage metrics

4. **Split Features**
   - Separate features (input variables) from the target variable (churn status)
   - Divide data into relevant categories (e.g., customer demographics, service usage, billing info)

5. **Train-Test Split**
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Essential for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data

## Preprocessing

- **Numeric Features**
  - Scale numerical data like call duration, monthly charges, total charges
  - Normalize or standardize to ensure all features are on a similar scale

- **Categorical Features**
  - Encode categorical variables like contract type, internet service, payment method
  - Use techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding

- **Imputation**
  - Fill in missing values in the dataset
  - Use methods appropriate for telcom data (e.g., mean for usage metrics, mode for categorical data)

- **One-Hot Encoding**
  - Convert categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms
  - Particularly important for variables like service types or customer segments

## Feature Engineering

- **Interaction Features**
  - Create new features by combining existing ones
  - Example: Interaction between contract length and monthly charges

- **Aggregated Features**
  - Develop summary statistics or aggregated metrics
  - Example: Total usage across different services, average monthly spend

## Model Development

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Apply the engineered features to the dataset

2. **Base Models**
   - Train multiple base models suited for churn prediction:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost or LightGBM)
     - Support Vector Machines

3. **Ensemble**
   - Combine predictions from base models
   - Use methods like voting, averaging, or stacking

4. **Evaluation**
   - Assess model performance using metrics relevant to churn prediction:
     - ROC-AUC
     - Precision-Recall curve
     - F1-score

5. **Interpretability**
   - Analyze feature importance
   - Use techniques like SHAP values to understand model decisions

6. **Transfer Learn**
   - If applicable, apply transfer learning from similar churn prediction tasks

7. **Online Learn**
   - Implement online learning capabilities to adapt to new patterns in customer behavior

## Model Saving

- **Save Preprocessor**
  - Store the preprocessing pipeline for consistent data transformation

- **Save LSTM Model**
  - If an LSTM model is used for sequence data (e.g., time series of customer interactions)

- **Save Base Models**
  - Store individual base models for future use or analysis
